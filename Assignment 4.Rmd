This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Grab movie data from destination
mydata <- read.csv(url("http://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/ggplot2/movies.csv"))

#determine what's in the table
head(mydata)

#take a subset of data for analysis
#in below sample, i'm looking at movies that are at least an hour in length and released in 2005
shorten_data <- mydata[ mydata[,3]==2005 & mydata[,4]>=60,1:7]
head(shorten_data,100)

#Find out how many nulls are in budget column
nrow(shorten_data)
sum(is.na(shorten_data$budget))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)

#Of the 292 standard lengthed movies made in 2005, most of the rating are above average. Users rating tends be slightly positive  than extreme poor/good.
hist(shorten_data$rating, main="Rating Histogram", xlab="rating")

#I want to look at the correlation between budget and rating. Interestingly, the scatterplot shows while there are always exception to the rules, of the 81 films that has a budget, the higher budget films are more likely to receive mediocre rating whereas the low budget films received evenly distributed rating
plot(budget~rating, data = shorten_data)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
